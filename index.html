							## The Cool Stuff:

							* A greater understanding of the Cosmos and our place within it through firsthand observation
							* Impress the girl or guy you like by looking into spaaaaaace
							* Become the hero of your Facebook feed by posting something other than selfies and baby pictures
						</script>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							## The Not So Cool Stuff:

							* Weather and cloud cover adds a level of unpredictability
							* Light pollution limits potential more often than not
							* Obtaining better equipment gets very expensive very quickly

							## Dim and Dimmer

							The brightness of celestial objects generally determines how difficult they are to photograph. Much like ordinary photography, the more light you can capture, the more data you have to work with.
						</script>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							<img src="img/moon_tiny.png" alt="Waxing Gibbous Moon" />

							Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Moon is the easiest night sky object to photograph. In many cases, simply holding a smartphone camera to the eyepiece of a telescope will yield decent results.

							######This was taken with a Canon T3 attached to a dobsonian telescope.

							<img class="inline" src="img/saturn.png" alt="Saturn" />

							Jupiter is generally the brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus, while Saturn is slightly dimmer with a noticeable tan tinge. A low power telescope yields an impressive view of Jupiter's cloud bands and Saturn's rings.

							Astrophotography isn't limited to close up shots of distant celestial objects. A professional camera and lens can yield impressive wide field shots when mounted on a tripod.

							## What about nebulae, galaxies, and all that jazz?

							We'll cover that, but more often than not, images of so-called *Deep Sky Objects* (DSO's) are beyond one's budget - and skill - when first starting out.

							## Telescopes: A Peculiar Form of Time Travel

							While not required for astrophotography, telescopes have the distinct advantage of being useful with or without a camera attached.

							Two attributes determine the general use of a telescope: the **optics** it employs and the **mount** it rests on.
						</script>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							All telescope optics work under the same general principle: collect and focus distant light to magnify and enhance a celestial object.

							Telescopes used for amateur astronomy and astrophotography tend to fall into one of three categories: *refractors*, *reflectors*, and *catadioptric*.

							A number of factors determine the effective "power" of a telescope, but the most important attribute is its *aperture* - the diameter of its primary lens or mirror.

						</script>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							The telescope mount affects both its ease of use and its effectiveness in viewing various targets, especially over time.

							<img src="img/dobsonian-telescope.png" alt="Dobsonian Telescope" />

							Most Dobsonian Telescopes, like this one, use an *alt-azimuth* mount. They can freely pitch and rotate along two axes.

						</script>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							An *equatorial* mount also rotates along two axes, except that one is aligned with the rotational axis of the Earth. In astronomical terms, this axis is known as *right ascension*.

							<img src="img/eq-telescope.jpg" alt="A Maksutov-Cassegrain on a German eq mount" />

							Equatorial mounts, while more difficult to set up and use, are better at tracking objects across the sky.

							### It's Not the Stars - it's You

							Bright objects like the Moon and planets don't require long exposures to get good data.

							When you try to photograph more distant objects, you'll likely discover another problem: they tend to move.

							Much like trying to photograph your cat, taking long exposures of distant objects will result in blurring or streaking.
						</script>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							Stars slowly march across the sky due to the rotation of the Earth. To get a decent exposure, your equipment must be able to track them.
						</script>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							With an *alt-azimuth* mount, like a camera tripod or most Dobsonian telescopes, tracking stars requires movement along two different axes.

							<img src="img/sky-altaz-grid.png" alt="Sky with Alt-Azimuth Coordinate Grid" />
						</script>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							An *equatorial* mount, although less intuitive, is better suited to tracking stars. One axis is aligned with Polaris, which corresponds to the northern pole on the celestial sphere.

							<img src="img/sky-eq-grid.png" alt="Sky with Equatorial Coordinate Grid" />

							Stars move along the axis of right ascension. Many equatorial mounts are motorized to match the rotation of the Earth along this axis, allowing a camera to remain fixed on an object for long periods of time.

							## The Right Light

							While there are special cameras dedicated to astrophotography - specialized webcams and astronomical CCD cameras - your run-of-the-mill DSLR or professional camera will work just fine.

							The principles of *shutter speed*, *ISO*, and *aperture* (when not using a telescope) still apply. However, astrophotographers employ some other techniques to collect more data.
						</script>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							Many astrophotographers use *filters* to block or single out specific wavelengths to enhance their pictures.

							<img src="img/mars-filter.png" alt="Mars Filter" />

							* *Neutral Density Filters* are commonly used to photograph the Moon. Through a telescope, the Moon is extremely bright, and these filters help reduce glare and enhance contrast.
							* *Color Filters* are often used for planetary photography. They help reveal features that may be lost under natural conditions.
							* *Nebular Filters* often limit light to a very narrow band of wavelengths. They are often used on nebulae which emit specific wavelengths based on their chemical composition.
						</script>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							The wavelengths you collect can significantly affect how a celestial object appears.

							Consider the Crab Nebula, observed at various wavelengths including radio, infrared, visible light, and ultraviolet.

							### When in Doubt, More Pixels

							For planetary and lunar photography, you can often get excellent results by using the video mode on your camera.

							Instead of a handful of images, shooting video effectively provides you with hundreds or thousands of individual frames. The best frames can be *stacked* together to create a quality image.
						</script>
					</section>

							### From Raw Data to Sweet Pics on Instagram

							Collecting pictures is only half the journey: astrophotographers can employ a large amount of post-processing to squeeze the data out of every pixel.
						</script>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							*Stacking* is commonly used in astrophotography. It combines the best data from a large number of images together into one final image. Stacking is an excellent way to reduce noise in lunar or planetary photos.

							<img src="img/moon_stacked_example.png" alt="Example of Lunar Image Stacking" />

							As an example, this image of the lunar surface was created by stacking approximately 1500 individual frames.
						</script>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							There are numerous free programs you can use to stack and post-process your images.

							* *PIPP (Planetary Image Pre-Processor)* helps preprocess frames from video files for stacking.
							(https://sites.google.com/site/astropipp/)
							* *Autostakkert! 2* is a small, efficient, easy to use program for image stacking. (http://www.autostakkert.com/)
							* *Registax* provides a suite of tools for stacking and post-processing astro images. (http://www.astronomie.be/registax/)

						## So Where Do I Start?

						You don't need to drop thousands of dollars on equipment to start taking great pictures.

						Get familiar with the sky first. A beginner's telescope costs less than an iPad Mini.

						An entry-level DSLR is $3-400, or even cheaper if you stalk eBay or camera deal sites.

						## Resources and Additional Research

						*The Backyard Astronomer's Guide* by Terrence Dickinson & Alan Dyer is an excellent book for getting started on astrophotography and amateur astronomy. (http://amzn.com/1554073448)

						There are numerous subreddits dedicated to astrophotography and helping beginners learn the ropes:

						* reddit.com/r/astrophotography
						* reddit.com/r/astronomy
						* reddit.com/r/telescopes

						Astrobin - it's like Flickr, but dedicated to astrophotography. (http://www.astrobin.com/)
